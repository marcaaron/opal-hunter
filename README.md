# Opal Hunter
## A very simple responsive shopping cart app built with React

![iPhone app example](https://image.ibb.co/bWYbsR/Screen_Shot_77.png)

Inventory 'database' is served as static JSON file, but could be adapted for hosted database use. The concept is built around unique items with a limited quantity of one such as the rare gemstone opal. As such, once an item is placed in the cart it can't be added again until it is removed.
